The world\u2019s busiest pedestrian intersection, the square is busy 24 hours a day, with nearly 40 million visitors a year.\n\nUntil 1904, it was called Longacre Square but was renamed after the New York Times moved to the new Times Building, now the site of the annual ball drop on New Year\u2019s Eve. The first electrified advertisement appeared at the corner of 46th Street and Broadway soon after.\n\nWith the onset of the Great Depression, Times Square was considered to be a very dangerous area thanks to its many seedy establishments. But during the commercial building boom of the 1980s, a long term development plan was undertaken and in the 1990s, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani led an effort to clean up the area.\n\nTimes Square is now famous for the diversity of activities on offer and its plethora of animated neon and LED signs\u2014named \u201cspectaculars\u201d; the largest being called \u201cjumbotrons\u201d\u2014that rival Las Vegas in density.\n\nThe Square has a huge tourist, entertainment, and corporate presence. You can visit museums, bars, restaurants, and world brand shops. The adjacent Broadway has 40 professional theaters offering plays, operas, musicals, and concerts. If visiting for New Year, you simply must join the crowds for the New Year's Eve ball drop; a brightly illuminated ball is lowered 75 ft (23 m) down a flagpole to signal the start of the new year. There are always special guests helping the Mayor lower the ball.\n\nWhen visiting Times Square, remember that it is a smoke-free area and if caught with a lit cigarette, you can be fined $50! The place tends to be crowded so watch your bag and personal belongings. Do not leave your children alone; dress them in bright colors so you don\u2019t lose them. In such a large pedestrian zone you can walk safely.\n\nTimes Square is at the intersection of Broadway and Seventh Avenue and spans from West 42nd to West 47th Streets. Because it is also a transportation hub, there are many subway stations around, including 49th Street, Rockefeller Center, Times Square, and Bryant Park.

Lamb and completed in 1931 in the Art Deco style, the building has 102 stories, 6,500 windows, 73 elevators, and is topped by a 203 ft- (62 m-) pinnacle. It was built as part of a fiercely fought competition in New York to be named \u201cWorld\u2019s Tallest Building\u201d, which it won, and the photos taken during construction (by Lewis Wickes Hine) are famous around the world . It now not only serves as a tourist spot, but also houses commercial and office space that welcomes about 21,000 employees daily.

What many tourists don't know is that there is a second observation deck on the 102nd floor. Almost a quarter of a mile up in the sky, it is the highest public point in NYC and offers a climate-controlled indoor gallery with even further-reaching views.\n\nLuckily, the Empire State Building is open 365 days a year to as late at 2:00 a.m. Remember to consider the weather and dress appropriately. It is also worth leaving plenty of time for your visit as there are usually lines at the ticket booth, security check, and elevators (so buying tickets online may help reduce waiting time).

It is one of the most popular attractions in NYC. Built by the famous and influential Rockefeller family, it became a National Historic Landmark in 1987.\n\nConstruction began in May 1930 and was the largest private building project ever undertaken in modern times as the initial costs were estimated at some $250,000,000. John D. Rockefeller funded the work entirely by himself. His initial plans to build an opera house were thrown out after the stock market crash in 1929, but his continuation with building the Art Deco center provided some much-needed work at the time and took nine years.\n\nNow home to the NBC studios and Saturday Night Live, Radio City Music Hall, and countless artworks, shops, and eateries, the Rockefeller center is also host to many NY events, including the lighting of the famous Rockefeller Center Christmas Tree, broadcast around the world!\n\nIts most famous building and focal point is the GE building, also known as 30 Rock. A tour of this and neighboring buildings will surprise you with its abundance of fine art, sculptures, (perhaps the most famous being the Prometheus bronze gilded sculpture in the Lower Plaza), mosaics, and murals. Or you can head up to the Top of the Rock Observation Deck for a wonderful indoor/outdoor viewing experience from 850 feet (259 m) above street level!\n\nThen you can indulge in a promenade of the Channel Gardens as it puts on a display of manicured grass, fountains, sculptures, and thousands of plant species! Or take a rest at one of the restaurants where you can sit within the famous ice-rink that comes to life in winter. But with over 40 restaurants on offer throughout the center, you\u2019ll have a hard time choosing.\n\nKids will love to explore the concourses (underground walkways that link the buildings) and some time at the LEGO Store before heading behind the scenes of a favorite TV show!\n\nIt's really easy to get there: Take subway train F, D, B or V to 47th-50th Street and get off at Rockefeller Center. Or take the bus from Fifth Avenue (M1, M2, M3, M4 or M5) to 50th Street.

The iconic, majestic statue is an absolute must-see while visiting the city.", "The Statue of Liberty, known officially as \u201cLiberty Enlightening the World,\u201d was a gift to the United States from France in appreciation of the friendship established during the American Revolution and has stood proudly in New York Harbor for over 120 years, becoming an internationally recognized symbol of freedom and democracy. Designed by French sculptor Frederic Auguste Bartholdi and funded through donations from the French people, the statue was created using an iron structure designed by Gustave Eiffel, who later built the Eiffel Tower.\n\nA Liberty figure already adorned most American coins of the time and she appeared in popular civic art, too. Libertas was the goddess of freedom and was widely worshipped in ancient Rome.\n\nBartholdi wanted Lady Liberty to have a peaceful appearance and it is said that she is modeled after his mother. The torch she holds represents progress and she wears a crown whose seven rays symbolize the seven seas and seven continents. She holds a tablet in her left hand that reads (in Roman numerals): July 4, 1776.\n\nThe statue was given to the American Ambassador in Paris on July 4, 1884. Transporting the 151ft (46 m), 225 t (204,100 kg) statue meant it had to be dismantled into over 300 pieces and packed into 214 wooden crates.\n\nThe pedestal was built by the United States, but this was delayed due to lack of funds. However, a revived effort to raise funds, led by Joseph Pulitzer through his newspaper \u201cThe World\u201d, saw the pedestal built and the statue\u2019s re-assembly. She was finally dedicated on October 28, 1886 in front of thousands of spectators.\n\nThe Statue of Liberty was named a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1984, and large-scale restoration began. Re-opening to the public in 1986, she stayed open until September 11, 2001, after which she remained closed to the public until August 2004.\n\nStanding over 305 feet, the statue has 354 steps inside and 25 viewing windows in its crown. A visit to Lady Liberty is a must and will be the highlight of your trip! The monument complex now also includes the nearby Ellis Island and its long immigrant history.\n\nToday, the Statue of Liberty is still a symbol of freedom and democracy, not to mention one of the world's most recognizable landmarks.\n\nYou can only get to the Statue of Liberty by ferry for which you have to pay, but entrance is then free. Ferries leave from Liberty State Park in Jersey City and Battery Park in Lower Manhattan. It is recommend you purchase tickets in advance; see the website for available options. Be prepared for a thorough security check including security screening (like in airports) when you get on the ferry; you may be asked to surrender suspicious objects (no sharp items like scissors or tools are allowed). Wait times can be several hours, particularly during peak seasons and on weekends. No food or drinks can be taken in. Large packages and suitcases will not be permitted on the ferries and there are no lockers. All visitors must keep items (including strollers) with them at all times.

Listed as one of the greatest streets to visit in the USA by the American Planning Association in 2012, this historic street is not just about shopping. It is also home to some marvelous museums, parks, exclusive apartments, and historical landmarks.\n\nSome exclusive fashion brands can be found along this street, including Louis Vuitton, Tiffany & Co., Gucci, Prada, and Armani to name just a few, and jewelry brands like Cartier, Omega, and Swarovski! Those who break into a sweat just reading the names might prefer shops like Tommy Hilfiger, Escada, Gap, and Diesel, also situated here. There are luxury department stores; Lord & Taylor, Saks Fifth Avenue, Barneys, and Bergdorf Goodman, too. One of the most photographed buildings in New York is also here; the Apple Store.\n\nThe high status of Fifth Avenue originates from the stylish neighborhood of Washington Square that extended along it, and its status as such was confirmed when the prominent American socialite, Caroline Schermerhorn Astor, moved there in 1862. The site of her house later became that of the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel and then the site of the Empire State Building. The avenue gradually lost its residential status. The very first commercial building was a department store, opened in 1906, that attracted fashionable women and other stores that wanted their custom. It was one of the few major streets in Manhattan that didn\u2019t have streetcars, offering instead the Fifth Avenue Coach, which appealed more to its fashionable gentlefolk (despite, or possibly because of, its elevated fare!)\n\nFifth Avenue is littered with New York City landmarks; the 500 Fifth Avenue Building, the Aeolian Building (Elizabeth Arden Building), the George W. Vanderbilt Residence, the Goelet Building (Swiss Center Building), the Gorham Building, the Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company Building, the Rizzoli Building, Saks Fifth Avenue, the Sidewalk Clock, and the St. Regis Hotel.\n\nBut it doesn\u2019t stop there; the street is waiting to surprise you with many national historic landmarks too, like the Empire State Building, the Flatiron Building, the New York City Public Library, the Rockefeller Center, and St. Patrick\u2019s Cat\u00adhedral!\n\nAnd, oh, how this street changes on its many parade days! Fifth Avenue is the traditional street for holding celebratory parades in New York, the most famous and longest running of which is the annual St. Patrick\u2019s Day Parade.\n\nIt is easy to get to Fifth Avenue; you can either take subway E or M and get off at Fifth Ave/53rd Street, or take buses M1, M2, M3, M4 or M5. Or if you want to save your energy (but not your money) for shopping, why not stay in one of the nice hotels that the street has to offer!"], "admission": "", "hours": "", "related_locs": ["Fashion on Fifth Avenue Shopping Tour"], "address": "", "attributes": [["icn-wikipedia", "Wikipedia\nen.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fifth_Avenue", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fifth_Avenue"], ["icn-phone detail-link-green ng-hide", "", "tel:"], ["icn-location-full detail-link-blue detail-link-wrap ng-hide", "", null], ["icn-at detail-link-blue ng-hide", "", "mailto:"]]},{"name": "Macy's", "tags": ["", "POPULAR", "SHOPPING"], "text": ["New York's iconic department store.
